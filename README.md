# react-native-acc
React-native module wrapping [Android](http://docs.accengage.com/display/AND) and [iOS](http://docs.accengage.com/display/IOS/iOS) Accengage native SDKs.

### Features
<u>For Android</u>

* InApp (without geofencing and beacons)
* Scheduled Alarms (without geofencing and beacons)
* Analytics (Events, Views, Device Info, Static Lists)

If you want to use ***push notifications for GCM***, ***geofencing*** and ***beacons***, please add additional corresponding accengage react-native modules: [react-native-gcm](https://github.com/Accengage/accengage-mobile-react-native-push-gcm), [react-native-geofences](https://github.com/Accengage/accengage-mobile-react-geofences), [react-native-beacons](https://github.com/Accengage/accengage-mobile-react-beacons). The fact that Accengage Android native SDK has [plugins](http://docs.accengage.com/display/AND/Plugins) allowed us to separate the functionality on different modules and do not oblige you to use, for instance, beacons and geofencing by default, as well as to have a possiblity to choose either GCM or FCM for you project.

<u>For iOS</u>

* InApp
* Scheduled Alarms
* Analytics (Events, Views, Device Info, Static Lists)
* Push Notifications

Checkout our [react-native sample](https://github.com/Accengage/accengage-mobile-react-native-demo) using these features.
